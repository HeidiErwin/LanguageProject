Things Heidi needs to do UI/UX/Unity-wise:
[DONE] refactor WordPiece into ExpressionPiece
[DONE] make a GameController class to set up the keyboard / add expressions to the screen
	   will definitely be useful if not necessary later anyways
[DONE] expressionPiece.CanAccept --> GET and KEY working fine, bug w/ F & X
[DONE] expressionPiece.DetermineUpdatedSprite
[DONE] expressionPiece.DeterminePreviewSprite
[DONE] delete Keyboard.cs if obsolete
[DONE] In expressionPiece.OnDrop: the dropped expression COPIES from the keyboard

1. when pieces combine, whole new piece!
2.  In expressionPiece.OnDrop: make sure you can only combine expressions in the workspace---keyboard should stay constant
4. Clean up comments
4. update ExpressionPiece image only when necessary

TODO with Bill Thursday:
	1. edit ExpressionPiece constructor to create its own Expression -- is this what we want? i.e. in the future, making 
	   an Expression will be done through making an ExpressionPiece
