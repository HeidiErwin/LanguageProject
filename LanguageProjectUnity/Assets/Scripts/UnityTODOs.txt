Things Heidi needs to do UI/UX/Unity-wise:

1. make a GameController class to set up the keyboard / add Words to the screen --
	will definitely be useful if not necessary later anyways
2. WordPiece.CanAccept
3. WordPiece.DetermineUpdatedSprite
4. WordPiece.DeterminePreviewSprite
5. In WordPiece.OnDrop: a. the dropped word "returns" to the keyboard and the current word changes to the new sprite
                        b. make sure you can only combine words in the workspace---keyboard should stay constant
