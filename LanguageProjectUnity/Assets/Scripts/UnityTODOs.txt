Things Heidi needs to do UI/UX/Unity-wise:

[DONE] refactor WordPiece into ExpressionPiece
[DONE] make a GameController class to set up the keyboard / add expressions to the screen --
	   will definitely be useful if not necessary later anyways
2. expressionPiece.CanAccept --> GET and KEY working fine, bug w/ F & X
3. expressionPiece.DetermineUpdatedSprite
4. expressionPiece.DeterminePreviewSprite
8. update ExpressionPiece image only when necessary
5. In expressionPiece.OnDrop: a. the dropped expression COPIES from the keyboard and the current expression changes to the new sprite
                        b. make sure you can only combine expressions in the workspace---keyboard should stay constant
6. Clean up comments
7. delete Keyboard.cs if obsolete

TODO with Bill Thursday:
	1. edit ExpressionPiece constructor to create its own Expression -- is this what we want? i.e. in the future, making 
	   an Expression will be done through making an ExpressionPiece
